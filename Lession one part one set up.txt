hello there and welcome

today's lesson is about setting up a html and css file
and if we have enough time we are gonna work on the navigation
tab so lets get into coding!

First we are gonna go and create a file for our website so am gonna name the
file (mariogamer) now once we made a folder we are gonna make a css folder
inside of the folder and then go on to our coding software (i recommand Visual studio code)

now we are gonna create a file and name it (index.html) index as in the main page
so after making a index file we are gonna make a (css) folder and then make
(style.css) file (please make sure the files are name style.css and index.html with no
uppercase or you may get into may bugs or problems)

now we are gonna go and create a (images) folder for all the images we are gonna use on our
site just simply make it inside the website folder and inport your images your gonna
use in lesson #2 and Done!

Now finally gonna add simple basic html code credits to (@Going-To Internet check him out on YouTube)
(add custom shortcut and title to the website)
which is:
<!--doctype html-->
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE-edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Awesome Website HTML</title>
	<link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/"/>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css"/>
<!--using-font-awesome-------->
	<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/c8e4d183c2.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

So now we got our html basic code setup we are gonna add aswell css code
heres there basic css code credits again to (@Going-To Internet):

body{
	margin:0px;
	padding:0px;
	font-family: calibri;
}

So congrats we have set up our website's folder and code
